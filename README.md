Welcome to my GitHub! I'm Jean Carlos, a systems engineering student. When I am not studying or programming, I play some music with my electric guitar, I like to read about personal and collective improvement, I love doing useful and fun things with programming, listening to different types of music, sharing with friends and much more.
